title: Why Raspberry Pi? 🥧
description: Let's talk about why we use Pi instead of Windows — and why your data might leave you like your ex did.

### Why Raspberry Pi? 💡

> Ever wanted a partner who forgives all your mistakes and lets you start fresh after a massive screw-up?  
> Yeah… that’s Raspberry Pi for you. 🫶

With a Pi, you can run wild with commands like:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /
```

**But hey, please don’t actually run that**, unless you enjoy turning your Pi into a very expensive paperweight.

The beauty? Even if you do mess up big time, you can just re-flash the OS onto your SD card and boom — it's back like nothing happened.

<Aside type="caution">
    ⚠️ Warning: The Pi will forgive you.<br/>
    💀 Your data, on the other hand, will ghost you forever, like that one date who said they'd "text back soon."<br/><br/>
    If you accidentally wipe your Pi, you'll just need to re-flash it. But your data? It’s gone. Gone like your will to live after debugging network configs for 5 hours straight.<br/>
    Well, unless it's on an external storage, and *not on that micro SD card* you are about to re-flash.

### Why not Windows? 🪟💔

> Windows and I have a complicated relationship. It’s like that one clingy ex who needs constant attention, restarts at the worst times, and randomly stops working just to "keep things interesting." 😒

When using Windows for servers:
    - Random forced updates at 2 AM? Check. ✔️
    - Restarting during your big presentation? Oh absolutely. ✔️
    - Slow boot times that make you question your life decisions? You bet. ✔️

Plus, Windows loves to hold your hand too much — which is fine in relationships, but in servers?<br/>
I need independence, not `Did you mean to click that?` pop-ups.

### Why not just use my PC?

Sure, you can use your PC… but:
    - A Pi sips power like a shy guest at a party.
    - Your PC? Chugs electricity like it's free beer at a frat house. 🍻⚡

Also, if you nuke your PC's OS for fun or in the name of science, your main machine becomes a doorstop.
But a Pi? Re-flash, reboot, and you’re back online, plotting your next questionable decision.

### The moral of the story

The Pi is like that understanding partner who lets you make mistakes, laughs them off, and says,
*"It’s okay, honey, try again..."*

Windows? More like...💥

Go forth, break things (responsibly), and remember:
    - The Pi might forgive you.
    - Your data won't.
    - And Windows will judge you from afar.
