## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

<Steps>
    1. **💡 Why did you make this project?**

        Because the world needed one more person to say, “I self-host everything.” Also, I like breaking things at 2 AM and then bragging about it online.

    2. **🚨 Is this only for Raspberry Pi?**

        Nope! While I use a Pi (because it's cute and forgiving when I `sudo rm -rf` it), you can run it on any Linux system, a virtual machine, or even that dusty PC in your closet.

    3. **💀 Will I lose all my data if I mess up?**

        *Short answer:* **Yes.**<br/>
        *Long answer:* The Pi will forgive you, but your data won't. Always backup before you start playing surgeon with your filesystems.

    4. **🌐 Can I expose this to the internet?**

        Technically yes, but only do it securely. Use VPNs, Twingate, or reverse proxies with SSL. Don’t open random ports and hope for the best — that’s how you end up featured on Shodan.

    5. **⚡ Why do you recommend DuckDNS or dynamic DNS?**

        Because most home internet connections don’t have a static IP, and DuckDNS is free, reliable, and doesn't ask for your firstborn child.

## 🧙‍♂️ Feature Requests & Ideas

Got a cool feature in mind? Like "automatic coffee brewing on server startup"?

Open a new **[Feature Request](https://github.com/deepesh611/Home-Server/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=)** on GitHub.
