<a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> is like that friend who shows up at every party, but instead of eating all your snacks, it brings neat little containers of apps to run anywhere. 🎁

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Internet access (no, your neighbor's Wi-Fi doesn't count)
- A user with `sudo` privileges (aka, your inner superuser unleashed)

## 📦 Install Docker

<Steps>

    1. **Update your packages**

        <Code code="sudo nala update && sudo nala upgrade -y" />

        Because outdated packages are like expired milk. You *could* use them, but you'd regret it.

    2. **Install dependencies**

        <Code code="sudo nala install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release -y" />

    3. **Add Docker’s GPG key**

        <Code code={`sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
        curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg`} />

    4. **Set up Docker repository**

        <Code code={`echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
        https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
        $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null`} />

    5. **Install Docker Engine**

        <Code code="sudo nala install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y" />

    6. **Enable and start Docker**

        <Code code={`sudo systemctl enable docker
        sudo systemctl start docker`} />

</Steps>

## ✅ Test Docker

Run the classic "Hello World" container to make sure you didn't accidentally summon a digital demon. 👻

<Code code="docker run hello-world" />

If you see **"Hello from Docker!"**, congrats! You now have a mini shipyard running in your server, and you're officially cooler than 99% of people who think containers only exist in shipping yards. ⚓🚢

    ⚠️ Warning: You may now experience an uncontrollable urge to containerize everything — even your relationship problems. Please containerize responsibly. 💔📦
