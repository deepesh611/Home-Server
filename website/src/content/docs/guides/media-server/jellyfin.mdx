Tired of algorithmic recommendations for shows you *pretended* to like?<br/>
**Jellyfin** lets you stream your own media — **no ads, no trackers, no judgment.**

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

- It's like Plex... but without the subscription emails.
- Organize movies, shows, anime, music — heck, your home videos from 2004.
- Host it yourself. Control everything. Never buffer again (unless your Wi-Fi sucks).

## 🐳 Docker (Because you like it neat)

By now, you're probably a Docker + Portainer ninja 🥷
So here’s your trusty docker-compose.yml for Jellyfin:
```yaml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
    jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin/jellyfin
    container_name: jellyfin
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
    - /path/to/config:/config
    - /path/to/cache:/cache
    - /path/to/media:/media
    restart: unless-stopped
```

<Aside>
    📦 Replace /path/to/... with actual directories or Portainer will cry.

## 🧰 Setup Guide (For native install — the “bare metal” way)
<Steps>
    1. Crack open a terminal. Take a deep breath. You're about to self-host Hollywood.
    2. Add the official Jellyfin repo:
        <Code code="curl -fsSL https://repo.jellyfin.org/install-debuntu.sh | bash" lang="bash" />
    3. Update your package index and install:
        <Code code="sudo apt update && sudo apt install jellyfin" lang="bash" />
    4. Start Jellyfin and enable it to auto-start:
        <Code code="sudo systemctl enable --now jellyfin" lang="bash" />
    5. Access the dashboard in your browser:
        <Code code="http://your-device-ip:8096" lang="bash" />
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
    🧪 Bonus Tip: Got a spare SSD? Plug it in. Mount it.
    Jellyfin + SSD = smoother streams than your ex’s Netflix password ever gave you.

## 🎨 Lookin' Good

Want to customize how Jellyfin looks?
    - Go to: Dashboard → Display
    - Choose themes: Light, Dark, Vaporwave, or "Did I just enter the Matrix?"
    - Add backdrops, posters, fanart — Jellyfin loves drama.

## 📱 Where Can I Watch?
    - Web browser (localhost or LAN)
    - Android & iOS apps
    - Android TV / Fire TV / Roku
    - LG / Samsung Smart TVs
    - Steam Deck? Yup, that too.
    - If your toaster can run a browser, Jellyfin probably works on it.

## 🔐 Lock It Down (Security Tips)

    If you're opening Jellyfin to the world:
    - Use an NGINX reverse proxy with HTTPS (Let’s Encrypt is free!)
    - Enforce strong passwords (no “1234”... please)
    - Disable public access unless you're cool with strangers watching your home movies
