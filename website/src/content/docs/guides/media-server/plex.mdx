Tired of hopping between 5 different streaming platforms just to find *that one movie*?
**Plex** turns your device into a media server — stream what you own, when you want.

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

- Central hub for all your movies, shows, music, and photos
- Remote streaming, metadata magic, and mobile apps galore
- More polished than Jellyfin, but partially proprietary
- Optional paid features via Plex Pass (but you don’t *have* to)

---

## 🐳 Docker (Because containers are cool)

Here’s a slick `docker-compose.yml` setup for Plex — run it, tweak it, rule your media world:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  plex:
    image: linuxserver/plex
    container_name: plex
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - VERSION=docker
      - PLEX_CLAIM= # Optional: claim token from https://www.plex.tv/claim
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config
      - /path/to/media:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

<Aside>
    🎟️ <strong>PLEX_CLAIM</strong> is like a VIP pass. Get it from [plex.tv/claim](https://plex.tv/claim) — if you want to auto-sign into your account.

    📁 Replace `/path/to/...` with actual folders or you’ll be staring at an empty library wondering where all your anime went.

## 🚪 Access Plex

Once it’s up and running:
- Visit:
    ```bash
      http://your-device-ip:32400/web
    ```
- Log in with your Plex account
- Add your media libraries (TV, Movies, etc.)
- Customize away

## 📱 Supported Clients (Basically everything)

You can Plex on:
- Web browser
- Android / iOS apps
- Apple TV / Fire TV / Roku
- Smart TVs
- Gaming consoles
- Fridge with a screen? Don’t tempt me

## 🧯 Security Stuff (Yes, you need this)

Planning to expose Plex to the internet? Do this:
- Set up a reverse proxy (NGINX + HTTPS FTW)
- Use strong passwords (Plex isn’t your diary, but still…)
- Restrict remote access or use a VPN if you're privacy-conscious

## 🛠️ Extras & Add-ons

Want to spice up Plex with cool features?
- Try Tautulli for monitoring who’s watching what (yes, even yourself)
- Add Sub-Zero for better subtitles
- Use Bazarr + Sonarr + Radarr to automate downloads and library management

<Aside type="note">
    🧩 Plex is modular — the more you add, the more it feels like your own streaming empire.
