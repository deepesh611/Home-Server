### Welcome to the dark side of home servers... 🕶️

> They say curiosity killed the cat.<br/>
> But in our case, it only killed some USB sticks, broke a few OS installs, and maybe destroyed your sanity.<br/>
> **Welcome aboard!** 😈

This guide will walk you through setting up your home server with the required packages, updating all the existing packages, and additional configurations like setting up a **static IP**.

I'll be using my **Raspberry Pi 5**. If you're using a PC or laptop, feel free to skip the Raspberry Pi Setup section and jump right into the fun parts.
Just make sure your PC is running **Linux** — preferably **not** Windows (unless you love pain).
You can try it in a **VM**, go **dual boot**, or go full chaos mode and wipe everything for a fresh Linux install.

## Prerequisites 📦

- Raspberry Pi 5 with power supply (or a PC/laptop if you’re feeling rebellious)
- MicroSD card (32GB or larger)
- External storage (HDD/SSD) if you want to hoard files like a dragon
- Keyboard, monitor, and Ethernet/Wi-Fi for initial setup

## 1️⃣ Raspberry Pi Setup 🛠️

<Aside type="note">
    Those using a PC/laptop can skip this part and proceed to the next section.

### Steps to Follow

<Steps>

    1. **Download Raspberry Pi Imager**

        Get it from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
        Trust me, using random ISO torrents is a great way to get new "friends" (a.k.a. malware).

    2. **Flash the OS**

        Use the imager to flash **Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** onto your microSD card.
        While flashing, enable **SSH** in advanced settings.

    3. **First Boot**

        - Insert the microSD card, connect to a monitor and keyboard, and power it up.
        - Follow on-screen setup. Pro tip: use Ethernet — Wi-Fi is like that friend who promises to help but always flakes.

    4. **Update your system**

        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade -y
        ```
        Watch those packages update. It's like watching paint dry but slightly more satisfying.

    5. **Install basic tools**

        ```bash
        sudo apt install nala -y              # APT’s glow-up
        sudo nala install openssh-server -y  # SSH server
        sudo systemctl start ssh
        sudo systemctl enable ssh
        sudo systemctl status ssh
        ```
        If SSH fails, take a deep breath. And maybe a shot. Then check logs.

</Steps>

### 🤖 Automated Setup Script

If you want to save time (and avoid copy-pasting commands like a caveman), you can use the provided `setup.sh` script.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepesh611/Home-Server/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
````
<Aside type="caution">
    💥 <strong>Important:</strong> Always read scripts before running them. Even if they look friendly, you never know — sometimes they have a dark side. 😈
</Aside>

What it does
<Steps>
    1. Updates your system
    2. Installs <code>nala</code> if missing
    3. Installs <code>btop</code> and <code>openssh-server</code>
    4. Starts and enables SSH
    5. Logs everything to <code>/var/log/script_install.log</code>
</Steps>


## 2️⃣ Assigning a Static IP 📡

Your server deserves a stable life. Floating IPs are for ghosts.

<Steps>
    1. **Find your gateway and MAC address**
        <Tabs>
            <TabItem label="Linux/macOS">
                <Code code="ifconfig"/>
            </TabItem>
            <TabItem label="Windows">
                <Code code="ipconfig"/>
            </TabItem>
        </Tabs>
        Note your `default gateway IP` and your server’s `MAC address`.

    2. **Router time**
        <Steps>
            1. Log into your router (usually via 192.168.x.1).

            2. Navigate to DHCP or Static IP settings.

            3. Reserve an IP for your server’s MAC address.
        </Steps>

    3. **Reboot**
        ```
        sudo reboot
        ```
        Your server now sticks to one IP, like that friend who overstays their welcome.

</Steps>

## 3️⃣ Assigning a Local Domain Name (Optional) 🌐

Make your life easier than typing IP addresses like it's the 90s.

<Steps>
1. **Router DNS settings**

    Find Static DNS options (mine lives under: Advanced > Applications > Static DNS).

2. **Set domain**

    - E.g., `server.local`
    - Point it to your static IP.

3. **Test**

    ```bash
    ping <server-ip>
    ping <domain-name>
    ```
    If this fails, scream into the void — or fix your router settings.
</Steps>

## 4️⃣ Accessing Your Server 🛢️

Connect from your PC/laptop:

```bash
ssh <username>@<ip-address-or-domain-name>
```
Default username is usually `pi` or `root`.

## 🎭 Conclusion

Congrats, you now have a basic home server setup!<br/>
Soon you’ll be serving files, running containers, and telling your friends, "Yeah, I run a server at home," while they stare in awe (or concern).<br/><br/>
