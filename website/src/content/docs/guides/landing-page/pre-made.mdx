## 🚨 Why dashboards?

So your server doesn’t look like a haunted house of random IP addresses and ports you keep scribbled on sticky notes.

Dashboards let you **see all your services at a glance**, link to them easily, and flex on your friends when they ask why your browser tab has a sci-fi looking homepage. 😎

You can view all the docker-compose files [here](/reference/ymls)

## 🔥 Featured Dashboards

### 1️⃣ [Homarr](https://github.com/ajnart/homarr)

A beautiful, widget-based dashboard that lets you throw all your apps in one cozy room.
Comes with service linking, widgets, and authentication — like a Swiss army knife, but prettier.

---

### 2️⃣ [Dashy](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy)

For those who want **total control**, like a cat knocking things off a shelf just because they can.
Super customizable, tons of integrations, and a big community to share your "look what I made" screenshots with.

---

### 3️⃣ [Heimdall](https://github.com/linuxserver/Heimdall)

Simple, elegant, and reliable.
No nonsense, no extra fluff — just pure, minimalist service listing.

---

### 4️⃣ [Flame](https://github.com/pawelmalak/flame)

Minimalist vibes only.
Dark mode, bookmarks, basic authentication — and super lightweight.
Perfect for those who believe "less is more" (and want to actually see their wallpaper again).

---

### 5️⃣ [Organizr](https://github.com/causefx/Organizr)

Tabs, tabs everywhere.
A power-user dream: unify all your self-hosted apps under one sleek roof.<br/>
*May cause you to spend 3 hours tweaking tabs instead of actually doing work. 😅*

## 🚀 Quick Start

<Aside type="note">
    If you like clicking buttons more than typing scary terminal commands, you can deploy these using <b>Portainer</b> too!
    We won’t tell anyone. 🤫
</Aside>

### 💣 Steps to blast off

<Steps>
    1. Pick your favorite dashboard (or all of them if you’re a digital hoarder).

    2. Copy its Docker Compose file to your server.

    3. Run this in the same directory:
        ```bash
        docker compose -f <chosen-dashboard>.yml up -
        ```
</Steps>

<br/> **OR**<br/> Deploy using [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io):

<Steps>
    1. Open Portainer in your browser (`http://<server-ip>:9000`).
    2. Go to **Local > Stacks > Add Stack**.
    3. Paste the contents of the compose file you chose.
    4. Adjust ports, volumes, and other settings if needed (don’t be that person who ignores all settings and cries later).
    5. Smash that Deploy button.
</Steps>


<Aside type="tip">
    If you want your dashboard to open automatically when you type just <code>http://&lt;server-ip&gt;</code> (no weird port numbers), set your <b>Host-Port</b> to 80 in the Docker Compose file.<br/> For example: <code>80:7575</code> for Homarr.
</Aside>

4️⃣ Open your browser and go to:
```bash
http://(your-server-ip):(dashboard-port)
```
Replace (dashboard-port) with the port from your Compose file — like 7575, 8080, etc.

## 🎉 Final Words

Enjoy your shiny new dashboards!
Now you can stop explaining your services to friends like a conspiracy theorist drawing on a whiteboard. Instead, just send them a screenshot and let them be confused in style. 🚀
