import {Code, Steps} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Welcome to the **Home Server Dashboard**, your shiny central landing page for managing and accessing all those cool services running on your home server (bonus points if you call it your “bat cave”). 🦇

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Custom Landing Page**
  One-click access to all your tools: file managers, media servers, or that suspiciously empty "AI Lab" folder.

- **File Server Access**
  Manage your hoarded files like a digital dragon.

- **Media Streaming**
  Easily jump to Jellyfin, Plex, or wherever you watch those "legally obtained" movies.

- **Dynamic Wallpapers**
  Wallpapers that change based on the time — because who doesn’t love a moody sunset at 3 AM?

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **UI Components**: [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/)
- **Hosting**: [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi with microSD, SSD, or that HDD you found in a drawer

---

## 📦 Installation Guide

### ✅ Prerequisites

- A Raspberry Pi (or other Linux box) running a Debian-based OS
- Git, Node.js (for Next.js), and Nginx installed
- Some patience and a playlist to vibe with

---

### 🔧 Steps
<Steps>

    1. **Clone the Repository**

        <Code code="git clone https://github.com/deepesh611/Home-Server.git
         cd '.\5 - Server Landing Page\Custom Dashboard\Sample Landing Page\'" lang="bash" />

    2. **Install Dependencies**

        <Code code="npm install" lang="bash" />

    3. **Build the Static Files**

        <Code code="npm run build
        npm run export" lang="bash" />

        The static site will be generated inside the `out/` directory. 🎉

    4. **Set Up Nginx**

        - Move the `out/` files to your web root:

        <Code code="sudo cp -r out/* /var/www/html/" lang="bash" />

        - Restart Nginx:

        <Code code="sudo systemctl restart nginx" lang="bash" />

</Steps>

## ✅ Final Result

You can now show off your dashboard by visiting:

```bash
http://localhost
# or
http://<your-server-ip>
```

<Aside type="note"> If you see an empty page, don’t panic — double-check your Nginx config and make sure you didn’t accidentally move your cat into `/var/www/html/`. </Aside>

## 📁 Customize

- Add or remove links in your Next.js components.
- Tweak the wallpaper logic (you can go full hacker mode with day/night cycles or even API-based themes).
- Style it even further with Tailwind CSS, or sprinkle in some dark magic using custom CSS.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

Congrats — you've basically built your own self-hosted portal to the universe.
Feel free to brag to your friends, "I don't use Google Drive, I have my own dashboard." 😎

## ⚡ Happy hacking! 🚀
