Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) is that friend who handles all your awkward "Who do I talk to?" situations — but for your servers.

It gives you a beautiful UI, free SSL via Let’s Encrypt, and makes you feel like an absolute wizard, even if you're just clicking around and hoping it works. 🧙‍♂️✨

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

<Aside type="tip">
    💡Deploy your Nginx Proxy Manager container using **Portainer** for maximum clicky-click convenience.

    <Steps>
        1. Open Portainer and log in (try to remember that strong password you set 👀).
        2. Select your **Local** environment.
        3. Navigate to **Stacks** (think of it as your container playlist 🎵).
        4. Click **Add Stack**.
        5. Give your stack a cool name (e.g., `nginx-proxy-army`).
        6. Paste your `yml` configuration directly, or upload your `.yml` file if you like feeling fancy.
        7. Click **Deploy the stack**, sit back, and watch the magic happen. ✨
    </Steps>

<Steps>

    1. Create Docker Network

        <Code code="docker network create nginx" lang="bash" />

        Because your containers deserve their own exclusive VIP lounge. 💃


    2. Docker Compose File

        Use a Docker Compose file for easier management.
        Check out 👉 [`nginx.yml`](reference/ymls).

    3. Start the Container

        <Code code="docker compose -f nginx-proxy-manager-compose.yml up -d" lang="bash" />

        Give it a moment to spin up. Grab some coffee, or stare blankly at your terminal wondering if you did something wrong.

    4. Access the Dashboard

        Fire up your browser and visit:

        ```bash
        http://<server-ip>:81
        ```

        > **🔐 Default Credentials:**
        > Email: `admin@example.com`
        > Password: `changeme`
        >
        > Like that one friend who never changes their Netflix password. Change it immediately!

</Steps>

## 🌐 Use Case 1: Point Root IP to Homarr

You want `http://192.168.1.100/` to show your Homarr dashboard (running on port 7575).

<Steps>
    1. Go to **Proxy Hosts** > **Add Proxy Host**.
    2. Domain Names: Leave empty (or your IP if needed).
    3. Forward Hostname/IP: `localhost`.
    4. Forward Port: `7575`.
    5. Block Common Exploits: ✅.
    6. Websockets Support: ✅.
    7. Save it. Boom.
</Steps>

Now, visiting your server IP takes you straight to Homarr, no more `:7575` tag of shame.

## 🌍 Use Case 2: Subdomain for Dashy

Want `http://dashboard.server.com` to show Dashy (port 8080)?

<Steps>
    1. Go to **Proxy Hosts** > **Add Proxy Host**.
    2. Domain Names: `dashboard.yourdomain.com`.
    3. Forward Hostname/IP: `localhost`.
    4. Forward Port: `8080`.
    5. Enable SSL:
        - Go to the SSL tab.
        - Check **Force SSL**.
        - Request Let’s Encrypt certificate.
    6. Save and flex.
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
    - Make sure your subdomain points to your public IP in DNS (e.g., via Cloudflare).
    - Use Dynamic DNS (DDNS) if your IP changes more often than your mood.
    - You can create as many subdomains as you want and brag to your friends like a true homelab lord.
</Aside>

## 🧑‍💻 Use Case 3: My personal setup

I use NPM to forward different requests to different internal services like a strict but fair bouncer at a nightclub. 🍸🚪

### ➕ How mine is set up

- When I open `http://localhost`, it forwards me to my **Homarr dashboard** running on port `7575`. This is like my home control center — everything at my fingertips!

- When I access `http://server.duckdns.org`, it forwards to port `5678`, which is where my **n8n** instance lives.

---

### 🌀 Wait… What’s n8n?

> **n8n** (pronounced "n-eight-n") is an automation tool, kind of like a self-hosted Zapier.
> It lets you build workflows to connect different services, automate boring tasks, and play God with your data.

---

### 🔑 What's that OAuth consent screen about?

When you want to connect your home server to Google APIs (for example, to automate Google Sheets, Gmail, or Calendar), Google needs to verify that you are... well... **you** (and not a robot bent on world domination 🤖).

- The **OAuth consent screen** is a web page where you log in to your Google account and authorize your server (n8n) to access certain data or perform actions on your behalf.
- Without this screen, your server can’t securely interact with Google services.

---

### 🌍 Why do I need `server.duckdns.org`?

- Your home IP address might change (thanks, ISP 🙄).
- **DuckDNS** gives you a free dynamic DNS (DDNS) domain that always points to your current home IP, even if it changes.
- This makes it possible to access your server remotely (or show Google a stable domain for the OAuth flow).

---

### 💬 TL;DR

- **Homarr**: Cool dashboard at `http://localhost`.
- **n8n**: Automation wizard at `http://server.duckdns.org`, with OAuth wizardry for Google.
- **DuckDNS**: Keeps your server address stable so you don’t lose your sanity.

<Aside type="caution">
    Never expose n8n or any sensitive service to the public internet **without protection** (like NPM, authentication, and strong firewalls). Or you might end up starring in someone’s hacking YouTube video. 💀

## ✅ Summary Table

| Address                       | Target Service    | Example Port |
|-------------------------------| ----------------- | ------------ |
| `http://<server-ip>/`         | Homarr Dashboard  | 7575         |
| `http://dashboard.server.com` | Dashy Dashboard   | 8080         |
| `http://media.server.com`     | Jellyfin          | 8096         |
| `http://files.server.com`     | Filebrowser       | 8081         |

---

## 💬 Final Thoughts

> "Expose yourself safely."
> — Nginx Proxy Manager, probably.

With NPM, no more typing ports like `:3000`, no more internal fights with your firewall, and no more "Wait, which service was on 8081 again?"

🎉 **Happy proxying!** 🛰️
