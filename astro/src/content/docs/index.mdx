## Why this guide?

> Confession time: I used to think you needed loud racks, blinking lights, and a basement full of servers to run your own “home server.” I was wrong. 😅

Turns out, almost **any device** can be a server.
- That old laptop you’ve buried in your closet?
- A Raspberry Pi? Even that dusty mini PC? `you know, the one your mom left behind after “that visit” 👀`
- Or that old desktop you forgot you owned? `Yeah, the one your sibling swore they’d fix but never did.`

    <Aside>
        If it serves something — it’s a server...
    </Aside>

    I was shocked when I first discovered this. So I decided to document everything I learned (mistakes and all) in one place, so you don’t have to repeat my confusion.

    ## 💬 Why am I doing this?

    Because I was once in your shoes — thinking I needed expensive gear and endless technical knowledge.
    I was wrong, and I wish someone had handed me a single, simple guide.

    So here it is.

    <Aside type="caution">
        You might find yourself telling people you “run a server” just to sound cool.<br/>
        `No judgment here, happens to all of us`.<br/><br/>

    ## ⭐ Final Words of Wisdom....

    Here are the steps to succeed
    <Steps>
        1. **Start small**

            How about opening the side panel of that PC for the first time?<br/>
            `It’s not a bomb, promise. Just some dust bunnies plotting world domination inside. 🐰💥`

        2. **Break things**

            `Better not forget. This is the most important step.`

        3. **Learn**

            Because after you break stuff, you'll definitely need to learn how to fix it. 😅🔧<br/>
            `That damn thing ain't fixing on its own, y'know.`
    </Steps>

    #####  🖥️ Your first "server" >> Might just become the coolest project you've ever typed `sudo` for....

    <Aside>
        For those who don't know what `sudo` is, here's a well known illustration...

        **If you are one of those who don't understand it, well....**

        . <br/>
        . <br/>

        Okay okay, just kidding. 😜

        `sudo` basically means "superuser do" — it lets you run commands with elevated privileges on Linux, just like **"Run as administrator"** on Windows. <br/>
        `This comparison with windows is just for understanding purpose. Trust me guys, sudo is capable of much more that just Run as Administrator`. <br/>


        And if you don’t know what *Run as administrator* is... well...<br/>
        🧐 Maybe it’s time to consider a nice hobby like gardening? 🪴😂
