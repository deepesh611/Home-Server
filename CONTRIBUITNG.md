## 💬 Code Style & Guidelines

- Keep your commits clean and descriptive.
- Follow existing coding styles (check other files and match them).
- Update documentation if your change affects it.
- Test before pushing. We love surprises, but not in production.

## 🧪 Testing
Please test your changes on a local setup (or your Raspberry Pi / VM). We don’t want other people’s dashboards mysteriously disappearing overnight.

## 🛑 Code of Conduct

Don’t be a jerk.<br>
Be kind, inclusive, and helpful.<br>
We don’t care how many RGB lights you have on your rig — respect is key.

## 🧙‍♂️ Need Help?
Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/deepesh611/Home-Server/discussions) or comment on an existing issue if you’re stuck. We promise to reply, sometimes even faster than npm install.

## ❤️ Thank You
