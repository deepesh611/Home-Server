# 🏠 Home Server Setup Guide

> **Confession time: I used to think you needed loud racks, blinking lights, and a basement full of servers to run your own “home server.” I was wrong. 😅**

---

## 🤯 Wait… really?

Yup. Turns out, almost **any device** can be a server.  
- That old laptop you’ve buried in your closet? 
- A Raspberry Pi? Even that dusty mini PC? `you know, the one your mom left behind after “that visit” 👀`
- Or that old desktop you forgot you owned? `Yeah, the one your sibling swore they’d fix but never did.`

> “If it serves something — it’s a server.”  
>   — *Me*

I was shocked when I first discovered this. So I decided to document everything I learned `mistakes and all` in one place, so you don’t have to repeat my confusion.

## 🌟 What’s in this guide?

I’ve put together a super beginner-friendly roadmap to help you build your own home server from scratch, at your own pace.

No gatekeeping, no complicated jargon — just clear, practical steps.

---

## 🗺️ Where do you start?

I broke things down into small, easy-to-follow sections. You’ll learn to:

- ⚡ Prep your device and get it on your network
- 🛡️ Access it securely from anywhere `without opening scary router ports!`
- 🐳 Run apps easily using Docker and Portainer
- 🏠 Make a cool landing page for all your self-hosted services
- 💫 Explore extra tools to make your setup truly yours

### 🟢 1. Get your server ready

We start with flashing an OS, assigning a static IP, and setting up SSH so you can control everything from your main computer `even in pajamas`.  
`Seriously, no need to sit in front of the server 24/7 — this is 21st-century lazy-friendly tech.`

[👉 Start here](./1%20-%20Setting%20Up%20Server/README.md)

---

### 🔐 2. Access it remotely (without fear)

Using Twingate to reach your server safely — no risky open ports needed.  
`Remember that nightmare story about open ports? Yeah, let’s avoid that.`

[👉 Check it out](./2%20-%20Remote%20Access%20to%20Server/README.md)

---

### 🐳 3. Install Docker

Run powerful apps as containers, without cluttering your system.  
`Think of containers as neat little boxes where your apps live, not hogging space or messing with each other.`

[👉 Install Docker](./2%20-%20Docker%20Setup/README.md)

---

### 🧑‍✈️ 4. Use Portainer to manage your apps

A beautiful, beginner-friendly web dashboard to manage containers without needing to memorize terminal commands.  
`Yes, you can click buttons instead of typing scary commands!`

[👉 Learn more](./3%20-%20Portainer%20Setup/README.md)

---

### 🏠 5. Create a landing page

Showcase all your services in one pretty dashboard.  
`Because staring at IP addresses is so 2010. Let’s make it nice and easy.`

[👉 Build your page](./4%20-%20Server%20Landing%20Page/Custom%20Dashboard/README.md)

---

### 🌐 6. Set up Nginx Proxy Manager

Make your services accessible by nice domain names (and add SSL too!).  
`Yes, “https://mycoolserver.local” is totally a thing.`

[👉 Get started](./5%20-%20Nginx%20Proxy%20Manager/README.md)

---

## 💬 Why am I doing this?

Because I was once in your shoes — thinking I needed expensive gear and endless technical knowledge.  
I was wrong, and I wish someone had handed me a single, simple guide.

So here it is.

Also, fair warning: you might find yourself telling people you “run a server” just to sound cool. `No judgment here, happens to all of us.`

## 🌟 Final words

Start small, Break things `Better not forget to do this. Its the most important step` & Learn.

Remember: servers don’t have to be scary, and neither does learning.

Your first "server" might just become the coolest project you've ever built.
